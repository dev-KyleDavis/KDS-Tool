v2.8.8 - 2025-08-17 21:53:44
Fixed bug where icon didnt update properly.

v2.8.7 - 2025-08-17 20:48:24
Stability Fixes

v2.8.6 - 2025-08-17 20:40:35
 Fixed Issue:
  The Enable/Disable buttons were becoming active mid-way through force operations because the UpdateStatus() method was overriding the button states during
   long operations.

  Solution:
  Added if (!isTaskRunning) check in UpdateStatus() method before updating button states. Now:

  - During force start/stop operations, buttons remain disabled throughout the entire operation
  - The periodic refresh timer won't re-enable buttons until the task completes
  - Only when EndTask() is called do the buttons get re-enabled through UpdateButtonStates()

  Technical Details:
  - UpdateStatus() is called by the refresh timer every few seconds
  - Previously it would set button enabled states without checking if a task was running
  - Now button state updates are skipped entirely during active operations
  - This ensures buttons stay grayed out consistently during force operations

Changed ICON

v2.8.4 - 2025-08-17 20:29:40
 KDService v2.8.3 - UI Responsiveness & Timeout Fixes

  Fixed Issues:

  1. Windows Services Button Not Responding
    - Made BtnWindowsServices_Click async to prevent UI blocking
    - Now uses Task.Run() to launch services.msc without blocking the main thread
    - Button remains responsive even during service operations
  2. 30-Second Service Start Timeout
    - Increased service start timeout from 15 seconds to 30 seconds
    - Added clear timeout messaging when services fail to start within 30 seconds
    - Enhanced error reporting: "Service X failed to start within 30 seconds on attempt Y"
    - Final failure message shows: "Failed to start service X after 3 attempts (30 sec timeout each)"
  3. Force Start/Skip Logic After Timeout
    - Services that fail normal start within 30 seconds get logged appropriately
    - On attempt 3, system tries WMI force start as fallback
    - If all attempts fail, service is marked as failed and operation continues to next service
    - No system hang-ups - operation continues smoothly

  Technical Improvements:
  - Better async handling prevents UI freezing during service operations
  - Clear timeout messaging helps identify problematic services
  - SSServices-style retry logic with enhanced timeout handling
  - Maintains UI responsiveness with Application.DoEvents() calls during wait periods

v2.8.3 - 2025-08-17 20:24:37
KDService v2.8.2 - SSServices-Enhanced Force Start/Stop

  Key Improvements:

  1. Better Windows Compatibility
    - Replaced garbled dropdown arrows with simple "v" character
    - Compatible with Windows XP, 2003, 2008 R2, 7 and above
  2. Enhanced Service Existence Checking
    - Now checks ALL services (not just Experion services) like SSServices does
    - Uses GetServiceByName() method that queries Win32_Service for any service
    - Matches both service Name and DisplayName properties
    - Properly handles optional services (no error for missing optional services)
  3. SSServices-Aligned Logic
    - 3-retry mechanism for each service operation (already implemented)
    - Process killing fallback when graceful stop fails (already implemented)
    - Proper service state checking before operations (already implemented)
    - Registry-based service configuration handling (already implemented)
    - Timeout handling with status verification (already implemented)

  Database Safety Features:
  - Only processes services that actually exist on the machine
  - Respects DefaultState attributes (Manual/Disabled services are skipped during start)
  - Uses exact same methodology as SSServices for service ordering and dependencies
  - Implements proper retry logic to prevent corruption from failed operations
